**Bandit Level 0-1**


**Level Goal**: The password for the next level is stored in a file called **readme** located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.


- Since you start at the home directory, you can inspect its content using the **ls** command which lists the readme file.
- Use the **cat** command to read the file
